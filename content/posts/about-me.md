<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

I‚Äôm excited by new technologies that can significantly change our lifestyles. I never settle for average. My best skill is that I am a team player.

## Work Experience

Previously, I was a Senior Software Engineer at [WeLend](https://www.welend.hk/en), where I developed the backend system in an innovative subscription program - the "Subscribe+ for Apple Products" program for purchasing Apple products üçé with Apple authorized resellers, which is the [first financial services provider in Asia](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6851400802746138624/).

I've also been a Software Engineer at [K11](https://hk.k11.com/), where I revamped the existing WordPress website with NextJS, resulting in a 10x faster load speed for e-commerce, enhancing the user experience.

And I've also been a Software Engineer at [HK01](https://www.hk01.com/), where I implemented an image service with tailor-made image options with a bitwise mechanism and deployed it to production, which served more than 28M visits and saved editors more than a thousand hours per month.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you want to dive deep into what I have done previously!
